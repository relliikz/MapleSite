This is a project i am developing that allows you to input your current gear,
including stars, potentials, and flames - and allows you to compare to your dream setup
==============================================================
current to do list:
-make it so when 1 collapsable menu opens, if there is
another already open it closes
-make it so selecting your class under the equip window (obsolete if we implement menu grid)
stipulates what class of gear/wse you will be offered
-make secondary collapsable menus (blue) with each field
-the best in slot setup needs to be already set up? [needs new solution]
-dynamic scaling
-saves cookies

--**HAVE DROPDOWNS SHOW SUBSECTIONS INSIDE THE DROPDOWN ITSELF 
(I.E CLICK DROPDOWN AND HEADER IS HATS, AND THEN IT SHOWS ALL THE HATS AS PICTURES,
THEN FURTHER DOWN IS TOPS SECTION ETC)
-**have flame section, star input, cube pot line input, and have an add button at bottom right

--**HAVE DROPDOWN MENU USE GRID OF IMAGES/NAMES THAT ARE ORGANIZED BY CLASS
