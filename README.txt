This is a project i am developing that allows you to input your current gear,
including stars, potentials, and flames - and allows you to compare to your dream setup
==============================================================
current to do list:
-make it so when 1 collapsable menu opens, if there is
another already open it closes (accordion?)
-make it so selecting your class under the equip window (obsolete if we implement menu grid)
stipulates what class of gear/wse you will be offered
-make secondary collapsable menus (blue) with each field
-the best in slot setup needs to be already set up? [needs new solution]
-solution for dynamic scaling equip window? (divs are static, maybe rescaling divs and image seperately)
-saves cookies
-fix flame form
-add all the image files in
-expand each button to have all the class equips, remove class button
-put outline selection and function per below on each section


--use the right side to display:
a)the items stats and information
b) the form to fix the flames/pot/stars underneath it
