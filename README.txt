This is a project i am developing that allows you to input your current gear,
including stars, potentials, and flames - and allows you to compare to your dream setup
==============================================================
current to do list:
-make it so when 1 collapsable menu opens, if there is
another already open it closes
-make it so selecting your class under the equip window
stipulates what class of gear/wse you will be offered
-add fields to insert data in collapsables
-the best in slot setup needs to be already set up?
