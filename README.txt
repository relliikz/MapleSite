This is a project i am developing that allows you to input your current gear,
including stars, potentials, and flames - and allows you to compare to your dream setup
==============================================================
current to do list:
-make it so when 1 collapsable menu opens, if there is
another already open it closes
-make it so selecting your class under the equip window
stipulates what class of gear/wse you will be offered
-make it so that clicking on a dropdown opens input fields relevant
to the item (i.e clicking on badge gives pot and star field, but not flame)
[figure out new solution to this?]
-the best in slot setup needs to be already set up?
-dynamic scaling
-saves cookies
-clear button for equip
